# Showing Some Humanity — End World Hunger

A single-page advocacy website raising awareness about global food insecurity. Originally built as a CodePath Web Development 101 project in Fall 2023, then redesigned in 2025 with a modern UI and improved functionality.

## About the Project

This site was created as part of CodePath's intro web development curriculum. The theme was social impact, and I chose to focus on world hunger — one of the most urgent and solvable crises of our time. The goal was to build something that felt real: a site that informs, moves, and calls people to action.

The 2026 redesign keeps the spirit of the original while bringing it up to production quality — better layout, real statistics, scroll animations, and a working petition form.

## What I Learned

The original project taught me the fundamentals: semantic HTML, CSS layout with flexbox, DOM manipulation, and event listeners. The redesign pushed me further into CSS architecture (custom properties, layered backgrounds, animation), responsive design, and thinking about UI/UX holistically — not just making something that works, but making something that communicates.
